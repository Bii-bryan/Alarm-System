# Alarm-System
Using an ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04) with Arduino Uno R4, assembling it and implementing it on an alarm system.
Components: Arduino Uno R4, Ultrasonic sensor (HC SR04), Active buzzer 5V (HXD), Breadboard, Jumper wires
Platform: Arduino IDE
- Firstly, attach the ultrasonic sensor and the buzzer on the breadboard. Then connect the VCC and GND pins on Arduino 5V and ground ports.
- After that connect the trigger pin to port 9, the echo pin to port 10, and the buzzer to port 8. Also attach the buzzer GND to Arduino GND.
- Upload the alarm-system-arduino.ino file
